Arco Linux Cinnamon multimedia starter "Arco Cinnamon Custom" (arccinc)

A working/rolling edit of scripts & helpers to start with Arco Linux base using arcolinuxd.iso & arcolinuxd.com tutorials with goal of evntually being able to migrate over to start from Arch in order to be able to create multiple, distict, ready to install distro's that are built for a combination of 3 priamry flavors.

    Gaming PC - to have steam, lutris, wine, & whatever I find that is needed to come as close or better than a windows PC.

    Audio Lab - Mosty with DAW & plugin support for High End Recording Studio interfaces (not sure about this one yet)

    Multimedia - Right now, a combo of Video Production Suite & Home Theater type systems. Will most likely be split.

    ATA - An All of The Above integrated distribution that could allow for 1 or more of each to be installed

The starting idea is to take the best of what I can find available now, use it to create a longer lasting idea where, much to my impression of Erik Dubois' articles, videos & websites, will be to allow the end user to both be able to investigate, research to learn how to further create own personalized end result, but give a good starting point so that if 1 or more of the above is the goal for now, the option is there to lay the ground work.

# Vision

This github will not only install the desktop.
But we will install all needed software.

We will also make it very easy to have a desktop you can be proud of.
All icons, themes, cursors, wallpapers, conky's  will be there.
Just select them.

Change the scripts to give it a personal touch.
Hashtag out the applications you do not want.

Copy/paste lines and add applications you do want.

And then run the scripts.

If we would make an iso, you would not have this choice, this freedom.
Now you do.

Learn, have fun and enjoy.
